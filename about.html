      <h3>Who are You?</h3>
      <p>Hello! My name is Tamara Slone. I was born and raised in the Appalachian mountains of eastern Kentucky. My passion for animation and game design led me to Seattle, Washington, where I pursued my dream of working in the tech industry.</p>
      <p>Although I started my career path in art and animation, I discovered a new passion for programming. My goal is to blend the beauty and creativity of art with the logic and structure of programming. While my main focus is web development, I also enjoy exploring game creation on the side.</p>      
      
      <h3>Skills</h3>
      <p>I'm a multimedia artist with a background in Video Game Design. I enjoy working with tools like Photoshop, Illustrator, and creating web vector images. I also have experience in 3D modeling with Maya and Blender, and I’ve done some design work in Unity. My focus is on blending creativity with technical skills to create engaging visuals.</p>
      
      <h3>Hobbies</h3>
      <p>In my free time, I love playing video games and jamming on the bass guitar. I'm also an avid reader and always eager to learn something new, whether it's a skill or a random fact. Gardening is another hobby of mine—I find it a great way to unwind and reconnect with nature.</p>
